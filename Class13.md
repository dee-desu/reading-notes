# More CRUD

---

**Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?**

PUT

**Which REST methods require an ID parameter?**

Update and Delete.

**What's the relationship between REST and CRUD?**

REST is an architectural system centered around resources and Hypermedia using HTTP commands. CRUD is a cycle meant to maintain records in a database setting. In its base form, CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands.

**If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**

1. Create a server.
2. Make routes (Read, Post, Update and Delete).
3. Create a data base with data.
4. Create a frontend.
5. Create a documentation.
