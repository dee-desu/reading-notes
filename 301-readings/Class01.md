# Introduction to React and Components

**1- What is a  "component"?**

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface, its also a software object intended to interact with other components.

**2- What are the characteristics of a  component?**

- **Reusability **: like unsing the component as many times as you want without the need to initialize it every time you need to use it.
- **Replaceable **: Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
- **Not context specific**: are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
- **Extensible**: can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
- **Encapsulated**: which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
- **Independent**: designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

**3- What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

-**Ease of deployment**: easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.
-**Reduced cost**: allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.
-**Ease of development**: Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.
-**Reusable**: they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.
-**Modification of technical complexity**: modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
-**Reliability**: overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
-**System maintenance and evolution**: Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
-**Independent**: ndependency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

**4- What is “props” short for?**

stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

**How are props used in React?**

- Define an attribute and its value(data).
- Pass it to child component(s) by using Props.
- Render the Props Data.

**5- What is the flow of props?**

The data within the props is passed i a uni-directional flow from parent to child (its also read only for the data coming from the parent cannot be altered from the child).

**Is react going to be the only front end method for the rest of the course?**
