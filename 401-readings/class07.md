* ## What is Jupyter Lab 
### JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter that enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

> ## NumPy
* ## What is NumPy
 ### NumPy is a library created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
 * ## Why Use NumPy ?

### In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

### NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

### The array object in NumPy is called `ndarray`, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with `ndarray` very easy.

### Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

* ## Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists ?

### NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

### This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.

### This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.
