### What is Big O notation?

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation.”

### Complexity of Big O

1. O(1) has the least complexity.
2. O(log(n)) is more complex than O(1), but less complex than polynomials.
3.  Complexity of polynomials increases as the exponent increases.
4.  Exponentials have greater complexity than polynomials as long as the coefficients are positive multiples of n.
5.  Factorials have greater complexity than exponentials.

## Names and Values in Python
1. Names can refer to values and many names can refer to one value. 
2. Names are reassigned independently.
3. Assignments never copies data.
4. Python is neither "Call By value" nor "Call By Reference", it's "Call by Assignment"!
